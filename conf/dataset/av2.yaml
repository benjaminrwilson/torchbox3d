# Argoverse 2 Sensor Dataset.

_target_: torchbox3d.datasets.argoverse.av2.ArgoverseDataModule  # Mapping to Python class for `hydra`.
name: av2

tasks_cfg:
  # Define tasks here. Each task corresponds to a detection "head".
  # Typically, similar classes are placed together.
  # There are many different ways one could define "similarity"; however,
  # one common way is by size.

  # Each class should have a unique integer key. Additionally,
  # the task keys should be contiguous (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...).
